## Demo Accounts

Demo accounts have got `demo data` to easily showcase all the features of Anofie.

1. We refresh the database every day.
2. While in demo mode, there are no restrictions except -
    * Deleting or Disabling user account.
    * Changing Username, email, password and profile pic.

To test in a specific language, we've mentioned language preference after each demo account- 
`e.g Roman Pane (Russian)`, so when you log in via `romanpane@mail.com` please change the language (see in the footer) to `Russian` to see everything in `Russian`
