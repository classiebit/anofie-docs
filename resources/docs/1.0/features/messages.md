# Messages


Send message anonymously from the user's profile `example.com/johndoe`. Anofie is an anonymous messaging system, your identity won't be exposed.

<br>
In the same way, when you receive a message, you can't see the Sender's identity. That's how Anofie works. Anofie is about sending & receiving messages without exposing identities even if you're a registered user.
