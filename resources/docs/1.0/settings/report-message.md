# Report Message

If in case of spam or abusiveness, the message can be reported from the &nbsp;<larecipe-button type="primary" rounded>Messages</larecipe-button>&nbsp; page, which will then be reviewed by the Admin from `Admin Panel`. The reported message gets removed from both the **Sender** & **Receiver** accounts.
