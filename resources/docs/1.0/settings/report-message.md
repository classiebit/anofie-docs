# Report Message

In case of spam, abusive or inappropriate message, the message can be reported from the &nbsp;<larecipe-button type="primary" rounded>Messages</larecipe-button>&nbsp; page, which will then be reviewed by the Admin. The reported message gets removed from both the **Sender** & **Receiver** accounts.
